The datasets of the paper: A soft-graphic encode-decoder neural network via adaptive interval normalization for multi-factor time-series prediction in complex partical applications. The warehouse includes two datasets, the Beijing Air Quality dataset, and the Greenhouse Environment dataset.  Each dataset is described as follows:
## Beijing Air Quality dataset
Can be described as a shape similar to a three-dimensional array (28, 744, 3). The three dimensions are time series, times, and variables. The sampling frequency of data is 1 hour. The variables within the datasets are the Value of AQI, CO (mg/m3), and PM2.5 (ug/m3).
## Greenhouse Environment dataset
Can be described as a shape similar to a three-dimensional array (4, 2967,4). The three dimensions are time series, times, and variables. The sampling frequency of data is 15 minutes. The variables within the datasets are Temperature (Â°C), Humidity (RH), Light Intensity (Lux), and Carbon Dioxide (g/m3).
